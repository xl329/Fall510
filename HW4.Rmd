This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Problems:
1. Create the vectors:
a) (1,2,3,...,19,20)
```{r}
a<-c(1:20)
a
```
b) (20,19,...,2,1)
```{r}
b<-c(20:1)
b
```
c) (1,2,3,...,19,20,19,18,...,2,1)
```{r}
c<-c(1:20,19:1)
c
```
d) (4, 6, 3) and assign it to the name tmp.
```{r}
tmp<-c(4,6,3)
tmp
```
For parts (e), (f) and (g) look at the help for the function rep.
e) (4,6,3, 4,6,3,...,4,6,3) where there are 10 occurrences of 4.
```{r}
e<-c(rep(tmp,10))
e
```
f) (4,6,3, 4,6,3,...,4,6,3,4) where there are 11 occurrences of 4, 10
occurrences of 6 and 10 occurrences of 3.
```{r}
f<-c(rep(tmp,l=31))
f
```
g) (4,4,...,4,6,6,...,6,3,3,...,3) where there  are 10 occurrences of 4, 20 occurrences of 6 and 30 occurrences of 3.
```{r}
g<-c(rep(tmp,times=c(10,20,30)))
g
```
2. Create a vector of the values of e^xcos(x) at x=3,3.1,3.2,...,5.9,6.
```{r}
x<-seq(3,6,by=0.1) 
y<-exp(x)*cos(x) #let y be the value of e^xcos(x)
y #output y
```
3. Create the following vectors:
a) (0.1^3*0.2^1,0.1^6*0.2^4,0.1^9*0.2^7,...,0.1^36*0.2^34)
```{r}
a3<-(0.1^seq(3,36,by=3))*(0.2^seq(1,34,by=3))
a3
```
b) (2,2^2/2,2^3/2,...,2^25/25)
```{r}
b3<-(2^(1:25))/(1:25)
b3
```
4. Calculate the following: 
a) sum of (i^3+4i^2), i=10~100
```{r}
a4<-sum((10:100)^3+4*(10:100)^2)
a4
```
b) sum of (2^i/i+3^i/i^2), i=1~25
```{r}
b4<-sum(2^(1:25)/(1:25)+3^(1:25)/(1:25)^2)
b4
```
5. Use the function paste to create the following character vectors of length 30:
a) ("label1","label2",.....,"label30").Note that there is a single space between label and the number following.
```{r}
paste("label",1:30)
```
b) ("fn1", "fn2", ..., "fn30"). In this case, there is no space between fn and the number following.
```{r}
paste("fn",1:30,sep="")
```
6. Execute the following lines which create two vectors of random integers which are chosen with replacement from the integers 0, 1,..., 999. Both vectors have length 250.
```{r}
set.seed(50)
xVec <- sample(0:999, 250, replace=T) 
yVec <- sample(0:999, 250, replace=T)
```
Suppose x=(x1,x2,...,xn) denotes the vector xVec and y=(y1,y2,...,yn) denotes the vector yVec.
a) Create the vector (y2-x1,...,yn-x(n-1))
```{r}
a6<-yVec[-1]-xVec[-length(xVec)]
a6
```
b) Create the vector (sin(y1)/cos(x2),sin(y2)/cos(x3),...,sin(y(n-1))/cos(xn))
```{r}
b6<-sin(yVec[-length(yVec)]) / cos(xVec[-1])
b6
```
c) Create the vector (x1+2x2-x3,...,x(n-2)+2x(n-1)-xn)
```{r}
c6<-xVec[-c(249,250)]+2*xVec[-c(1,250)]-xVec[-c(1,2)]
c6
```
d) Calculate the sum of e^(-x(i+1))/(xi+10), i=1~n-1
```{r}
d6<-sum(exp(-xVec[-1])/(xVec[-length(xVec)]+10))
d6
```
7. This question uses the vectors xVec and yVec created in the previous question and the functions sort, order, mean, sqrt, sum and abs.
a) Pick out the values in yVec which are > 600.
```{r}
a7<-yVec[yVec>600]
a7
```
b) What are the index positions in yVec of the values which are > 600?
```{r}
which(yVec>600)
```
c) What are the values in xVec which correspond to the values in yVec which are > 600? (By correspond, we mean at the same index
positions.)
```{r}
c7<-xVec[yVec>600]
c7
```
d) Create the vector (|x1-(x1+...+xn)/n|^(1/2), |x2-(x1+...+xn)/n|^(1/2),...,|xn-(x1+...+xn)/n|^(1/2)
```{r}
d7<-sqrt(abs(xVec-mean(xVec)))
a7
```
e) How many values in yVec are within 200 of the maximum value of
the terms in yVec?
```{r}
e7<-sum( yVec>max(yVec)-200 )
e7
```
f) How many numbers in xVec are divisible by 2? (Note that the mod
operator is denoted %%.)
```{r}
f7<-sum(xVec%%2==0)
f7
```
g) Sort the numbers in the vector xVec in the order of increasing valuesin yVec.
```{r}
g7<-xVec[order(yVec)]
g7
```
h) Pick out the elements in yVec at index positions 1,4,7,10,13,...
```{r}
h7<-yVec[c(T,F,F)]
h7
```
8. By using the function cumprod or otherwise, calculate:
1+2/3+(2/3*4/5)+(2/3*4/5*6/7)+...+(2/3*4/5...*38/39)
```{r}
1+sum(cumprod(seq(2,38,b=2)/seq(3,39,b=2)))
```
