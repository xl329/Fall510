Write an R function named explore that takes a data frame, a vector of bin sizes, and a correlation threshold as input parameters:
1) Plot a pair of blue histograms with a vertical red line at the mean (one using counts and the other density) for every numerical variable at each bin size specified in the bin sizes input parameter. You can plot individually or as a grid. If you chose to plot as a grid, there should be separate grids for each count-bin size combination and separate grids for each density-bin size combination. For example, given 5 numeric variables and a vector of three bin sizes will generate 30 individual plots or a total of 6 grid plots (with each grid plot containing 5 subplots).
2) Plot a gray bar graph for every categorical and binary variable.
3) Calculate the r2 (r-square) value for every pair of numerical
variables.
4) Return the following in an R list:
a. A frequency table for every categorical and binary variable 
b. Fornumericalvariables
i. A summary statistics table for each numerical variable
ii. A data frame that contains each pair of variable names and the associated r-square value.
iii. A data frame that contains each pair of variable names and correlation coefficient (Pearson) for all coefficients whose absolute value is greater than the correlation threshold (do not repeat any pairs)

5) Test your function by Using the diamonds data frame you extended to include the VS logical column, a vector of bin sizes (5, 20, 50), and a correlation threshold of 0.25. Also test your function using the mtcars data.
```{r}
require(ggplot2) #load ggplot2 package to get diamonds data frame
require(datasets) #mtcars is in package datasets, just make sure we have mtcars
data(diamonds) #load diamonds data frame
logicalcol<-c() #create variable logicalcol, and let it be empty first
ratioT=length(mtcars$vs[mtcars$vs==1])/length(mtcars$vs) #Calculate the ratio of 1 in the mtcars$vs variable, and put it in variable ratioT
trail<-rbinom(nrow(diamonds),1,ratioT) #create variable trail and use rbinom() to randomly input 0 and 1 into trail based on ratioT, and let the length of trail equal to the length of diamonds
for (i in 1:(length(trail))){ #using for loop to go through from the frist value to the last in trail
  if (trail[i]==1){ #using if() to check if trail[i] equals to 1
      logicalcol[i]=TRUE #if trail[i] equals to 1, write TURE in logicalcol[i]
      } #finish if(){}
  else{
    logicalcol[i]=FALSE #if trail[i] doesn't equal to 1, write FALSE in logicalcol[i]
    } #finish eles{}
} #finish for loop
newdiamonds<-data.frame(diamonds,logicalcol) #create a new data frame called newdiamonds and put diamonds and logicalcol into it
explore(newdiamonds, c(5,20,50), 0.25) #test explore() by using newdiamonds
#explore(mtcars,c(5,20,50),0.25) #test explore() by using mtcars
