This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

1. Figure out how to generically extract all numeric columns from any data frame so the method you develop can be used on any data.
```{r}
#In order to make sure the method can be used on any data, we will create a function to generically extract all numeric columns from any data frame.
numscol<-function(dataframe){ #create a function called numscol with an input data frame variable called dataframe in the function
  nums<-dataframe[sapply(dataframe,is.numeric)] #using "is.numeric" in sapply() to choose only numberic columns in dataframe, and create a variable nums that only contains those numberic columns in dataframe 
} #finish function
#assume we just open the Rstudio, need to require packages
require(ggplot2) #load ggplot2 package to get diamonds data frame
data(diamonds) #load diamonds data frame
print(numscol(diamonds)) #test numscol function by using diamonds data frame and output the numeric columns by using print()
```
2. Create a data frame that contains each pair of variable names in the first column in a single string separated by a -, e.g. for the variables x and y, you should form the string “x-y” (HINT: Look at the help provided for the paste function) and their corresponding Pearson correlation coefficient in the second column. (HINT: There is a function that calculates correlation coefficients – look carefully at what is returned and optimize how you extract the correlation coefficients). Do not repeat any pairs.
```{r}
#We will create a function to solve this problem. In the function, we will use for loop to create two variables, one is for pair of variable names and the other is the corresponding pearson correlation coefficient. Then, put the two variables into a data frame.
pearson_cor<-function(dataframe){ #create a function called pearson_cor with an input data frame variable called dataframe in the function
  Pair_of_variables<-c() #create a variable Pair_of_variables, will put pair of variable names in it
  Pearson_cor_coeff<-c() #create a variable Pair_of_variables, will put corresponding Pearson correlation coefficient in it
  dataframenum<-numscol(dataframe) #create a variable dataframenum that contains all numeric column names in dataframe by using the numscol() we defined above
  n=1 #create a variable n that will represent position in Pair_of_variables and Pearson_cor_coeff, we will use it to go through all positions in Pair_of_variables and Pearson_cor_coeff, let it equal to 1 first
  for (i in 1:(ncol(dataframenum)-1)){ #use for loop to go through from the first column name to the penult in dataframenum
    for (j in (i+1):ncol(dataframenum)){ #use for loop to go through from the i+1th column name to the last in dataframenum
      Pair_of_variables[n]  <- paste(colnames(dataframenum)[i],"-",colnames(dataframenum)[j],sep="") #using paste() to write pair of variable names in a single string separated by a -, and put into Pair_of_variables
      Pearson_cor_coeff[n]  <- cor(dataframenum[ ,i],dataframenum[ ,j],method="pearson") #using cor() to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the ith column and jth column in dataframenum, and write down the result in Pearson_cor_coeff
      n=n+1 #add 1 to n in order to go to the next positions in Pair_of_variables and Pearson_cor_coeff
    } #finish second for loop
  }#finish first for loop
  newdata<-data.frame(Pair_of_variables, Pearson_cor_coeff) #create a data frame called newdata, put Pair_of_variables and Pearson_cor_coeff into it 
  newdata #output newdata 
} #finish function
#if we just open the Rstudio, need to require packages and don't forget to open the numscol() function
#require(ggplot2) #load ggplot2 package to get diamonds data frame
#data(diamonds) #load diamonds data frame
pearson_cor(diamonds) #test pearson_cor() by using diamonds data
```
3. Create and label a scatter plot for every pair of numeric variables. Add a title to the plot that contains the calculated Pearson correlation coefficient of variables contained in the plot. (HINT: You should figure out how to extract all numeric columns from a data frame so your method can be used on any data frame.)
```{r}
#We will create a function to output all plots. In the funtion, we will require gridExtra package and use do.call() output all plots together as a whole, because par() can't be used in ggplot2. And in order to make sure the function can be used on any data frame, we will require ggplot2 and grid as well. The for loops will help us create plot between every pair of numeric vairables and write the plot into a varible. It will take some time for outputting plots. The plots don't look good in Knit HTML version, but it's ok in the R or RStudio plots output area
sca_plot<-function(dataframe){ #create a function called sca_plot with an input data frame variable called dataframe in the function
  require(ggplot2) #load ggplot2 package to get diamonds data frame
  require(grid) #load grid package to create plot
  require(gridExtra) #load gridExtra package in order to integrate all plots
  dataframep<-numscol(dataframe)#create a variable dataframep that contains all numeric column names in dataframe by using the numscol() we defined above
  splotall<-list() #create a variable splotall for a list of plots, make it empty, we will use it to put all plots
  n=1 #create a variable n that will represent position in splotall, we will use it to go through all positions in splotall, let it equal to 1 first
  for (i in 1:(ncol(dataframep)-1)){ #use for loop to go through from the first column name to the penult in dataframep
    for (j in (i+1):ncol(dataframep)){ #use for loop to go through from the i+1th column name to the last in dataframep
      plotdata<-data.frame(dataframep[,i],dataframep[,j]) #create a variable plotdata and put the ith and jth columns of dataframep in it. we just want to use the data to create plots in this iteration, so the plotdata will be refresh in the next iteration.
      colnames(plotdata)<-c(colnames(dataframep)[i],colnames(dataframep)[j]) #make the column names of plotdata be the column names of ith and jth column in dataframep
      xyPCorr<-cor(dataframep[,i],dataframep[,j],method="pearson") #using cor() to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the ith column and jth column in dataframep, and write down the result in xyPCorr
      splotall[[n]] <- (ggplot(plotdata,aes_string(x=colnames(dataframep)[i],y=colnames(dataframep)[j]))+geom_point()+ggtitle(paste("Correlation between",colnames(dataframep)[i],"and",colnames(dataframep)[j],":",xyPCorr))) #create the scatter plot for plotdata, the x label is ith column name in dataframep, the y label is it jth column name in dataframep, the geoms are points, the title is "Correlation between ith column name of dataframep and jth column name of dataframep:xyPCorr"
      n=n+1 #add 1 to n in order to go to the next position in splotall
    } #finish second loop
  } #finish first loop
  do.call(grid.arrange,splotall) #Output all plots as whole and display on grid.arrange by using do.call()
} #finish function
#if we just open the Rstudio, need to require packages and don't forget to open the numscol() function
#require(ggplot2) #load ggplot2 package to get diamonds data frame
#data(diamonds) #load diamonds data frame
sca_plot(diamonds) #test sca_plot() by using diamonds data frame
```
