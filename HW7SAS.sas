/*Level1:4. Accessing a Permanent Data Set*/
/*a.Use an interactive facility to explore the orion library and answer the following questions: */
/*Double click library->Orion->Country*/
    /*How many observations are in the orion.country data set? 7, because there are 7 rows.*/
    /*How many variables are in the orion.country data set? 6, because there are 6 columns.*/
    /*What is the name of the last country in the data set? South Africa */

/* b.Submit a PROC CONTENTS step to generate a list of all members in the orion library.*/
proc contents data=orion._all_ nods;
run;
/*Using _all_ nods to get a list of all members in the orion library.
proc contents will list the properties of the data set*/
/*What is the name of the last member listed? US_SUPPLIERS */

/*Level2:5. Viewing General Data Set Properties*/
/*a. Examine the general data set properties of orion.staff.*/
proc contents data=orion.staff;
run;
/*Using proc contents to examine the properties of the data set orion.staff */

/*b. What sort information is stored for this data set? */
/*The General Information section tells us that the data set is sorted. The Variable section tells us it is sorted by Employee_ID using the ANSI character set, and has been validated.*/

/*Chanllenge:6. SAS Autoexec File: Use the Help facility or product documentation to investigate the SAS autoexec file and answer the following questions.*/
   /*What is the name of the file? autoexec.sas */
   /*What is its purpose? It contains SAS statements that are executed immediately after SAS initializes, in order to invoke SAS programs automatically, set up certain variables for use during your SAS session, or set system options.*/
   /*How is it created? It can be created by any text editor, but the best way is to use a SAS text editor and save it by using the Save As dialog box.*/
   /*How could this be useful in a SAS session? It can be used to set the path macro variable and automatically submit a LIBNAME statement.*/
